# Cypress-Automation-Trayio

The task
You are to create an E2E UI test that will validate that weâ€™re able to successfully create and then delete a new workflow in the tray.io platform. Your automation must have the following broad steps:

1. Login to tray.io
2. Create a new workflow
3. Go back to dashboard
4. Delete the previously created workflow
5. Log out of tray.io

I have used Cypress Auotmation fraework to demonstrate this
